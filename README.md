# Fields of Mathematics classified by Wikipedia

The branches of a field of study in these days are so diverse, specified and inter-related with many area of studies. So, it is hard to determine if a topic from a discipline belongs to any of its sub field. Wikipedia is the biggest online encyclopedia which contains information about almost anything that can be documented with expertsâ€™ level of depth. Moreover, it consists of hyperlinked web pages, any two topics closely related to each other have a link from one to another of vice versa. Web pages of Wikipedia form a massive network itself. So, if you can get an information of the connections between web pages, we can analyze the topics in Wikipedia using techniques of classifying communities in networks. In this project, using links between popular mathematics topics in Wikipedia pages, we try to classify the sub fields of mathematics by its topics.

## Data set
The data of the project can be obtained from Machine Learning Repository website of University of California Irvine. There, on April 20, 2021, Wikipedia Math Essentials data set was posted on the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/606/wikipedia+math+essentials-1)
